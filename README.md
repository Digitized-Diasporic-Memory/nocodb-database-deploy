# Self-hosted NocoDB (0.264.3)

This repository was created from Railway's [NocoDB](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb) [deploy starter](https://github.com/railwayapp-templates/nocodb/). I update this repo to update the NocoDB software used for Digitized Diasporic Memory's [public-facing database](https://diasporamemory.com/database/).
